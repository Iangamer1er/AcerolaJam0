Game Jam theme "ABERRATION"
A departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one that is unwelcome.
You are the aberration in the face of the cult
You are (now) unwelcome

Game about being in old time warrior cult
You want to get out of the cult but to get out you have to play a game with the head chief  
You have been here before
Your character only has one hand and there are only 3 fingers left on it
The shief has huge bias when talking about the warrior god
The chiaf also has huge negative bias when talking about the other god
Both of these do not affect gameplay
The game is some kind of table turn base rpg but the chief is the game master
Fights are told and described by the chief
You are your character
The room is lit by candle
One of them has a knife on top of it
When you lose a fight the chief cuts one of the fingers with the knife
Then your character is fully healed
There is no visual indication for what remaining hp the ennemies have. Only the chief visually describe it
You know your own health
You can pray to the gods at some locations
Praying to the other god restores health. This angers the Warrior god
Praying to the warrior god gives boons
You can find armor and weapons on some locations
THIS IS A ROGUELIKE



Idea for combat if time allows me : 
When an enemy attacks, the DM hits a part of the table to plunge a stick towards the player's figurine. 
The player can then hit his part of the table on the block button to make a piece of wood block the attack
